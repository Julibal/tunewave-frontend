TuneWave — Demo Music Crowdfund Frontend
=======================================

What you get
- Single-page static frontend (no build step). Just open index.html in a modern browser.
- Fake songs (short WAV files) in assets/audio/ so playback works offline.
- Crowdfunding UI: artists can create campaigns, contributors can fund, and payouts are estimated based on streams.
- All data is saved to localStorage (browser).

How to run
1. Download and unzip the package.
2. Open index.html in your browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
3. Use the Crowdfund tab to create campaigns and contribute.
4. Play songs — each time a song finishes, it's counted as a stream and contributes toward campaign payouts (demo simulation).

Notes
- This is a frontend-only demo (no backend or real payments).
- All values are simulated and stored locally in your browser.
- For production you'd wire campaigns, payments, authentication and real streaming analytics to a backend.
